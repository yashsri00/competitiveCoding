1.two sum problem
Given an array of integers return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a
specific target
You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution and you may not use the same
element twice
Example::
given numbers=[2,7,11,15]
target=9

because numbers[0]+numbers[1]=2+7=9
return [0,1]


2.container with most water
Given  n non-negative integers a1,a2.....aN where each represent a point at coordinate (i,aj), n vertical lines
are drawn such that two endpoints of line i is at (i,aj) and (i,0) Find two lines which together with x-axis
forms container such that the container contains the most water
you may not slant the container and n is least 2

Example 1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7
Max area of water is 49

3.find the kth largest element in the unsorted array
for example::
input [3,2,1,5,6,4]
k=2
ans=5

input [3,2,3,1,2,4,5,5,6]
k=4
ans:4
